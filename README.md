UW-Madison Software Carpentry Workshop
=======================================
Welcome!

January 13-16
-------------------

3rd Floor Teaching Lab, Discovery Building, UW-Madison Campus
------------------

This repository contains the course material for the Software
Carpentry workshop hosted by UW-Madison's 
[Advanced Computing Initiative (ACI)](https://aci.wisc.edu) for researchers at the UW-Madison.

Setup and Preparation
-----------

You will need to bring a laptop to all sessions of the workshop. It is strongly encouraged 
that participants already have a basic understanding of programming concepts, like loops, 
conditionals, and arrays. Before you arrive, please 
[follow the instructions to install python and other software](setup/README.md).

Registration
-----------

Please see our workshop advertisement page for [registration](http://uw-madison-aci.github.io/2015-01-13-wisc/).


<!--
Pre-Camp Survey
-----------
Please fill out the [Pre-Camp Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vfTp6Z8jAZBau1P1SfHOjlYk023KlVk92yp0p-xx63Q/viewform), if you are in physical attendance at our Software Carpentry workshop on January 13-16.

Schedule
-----------

This workshop has been structured around the concepts put forth in the
recent paper "[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745)" by G. Wilson,
et al (at the top of this repository). In so doing, the sessions names 
have been chosen to correspond
with some of the most important practices to start early in the research process.
